522=Joseph: We were losing the war, I knew I had to do something drastic or face defeat.

523=Soldier: Sir, we've found a body matching his description.
524=Джозеф: Веди.
; Joseph: Lead on.

525=Khetana: That's not him!
526=Khetana: He's wearing his clothes but his face is somehow, different.
527=( Vega turns away for a moment. )
528=Vega: So he's escaped....
529=Khetana: Now what are we going to do?
530=Vega: We're going to do nothing.
531=Khetana: But he's still out there!
532=Khetana: We can't just let him get away!

533=Vega: He won't get away, one day his evil plans will be stopped, permanently.
534=Vega: As for today, fate has deemed he should slip into the shadows once more.
535=( Khetana crosses her arms with a menacing look on her face. )

536=Vega: Don't worry, his day will come.
537=Vega: I've had enough of this war.
538=Vega: Lets go home.

539=Вега: Солнце садится, и теперь наступают сумерки...
; Vega: The sun has gone, now comes the twilight....
